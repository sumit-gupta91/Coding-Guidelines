# Coding Conventions
This guide should not be considered a styleguide and is not written with a style guide in mind. This document however covers a few conventions which should be followed while writing code, these conventions when followed will lead to cleaner code. Clean code will lead to better readability, faster PR reviews, lesser bugs, decrease in TAT(Turn around times) etc etc.

## What is clean code ?

> I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does one thing well.

**Bjarne Stroustrup, inventor of C++.**

> Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose. Clean code never obscures the designer’s intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.

**Grady Booch, author of Object Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications**

> Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. It has unit and acceptance tests. It has meaningful names. It provides one way rather than many ways for doing one thing. It has minimal dependencies, which are explicitly defined, and provides a clear and minimal API. Code should be literate since depending on the language, not all necessary information can be expressed clearly in code alone. 

**Big” Dave Thomas.**

> You know you are working on clean code when each routine you read turns out to be pretty much what you expected. You can call it beautiful code when the code also makes it look like the language was made for the problem.

**Ward Cunningham, inventor of Wiki.**

## Clean code and Readability
If we read through all the thoughts of above people, one of the common thing is readability. `Clean code is readable and easy to understand by everyone whether the reader is the author of the code or a new programmer.`

## Why does Readability matter ?

Everyday job a developer can be broadly categorised into three things:
* The user wants to add a new feature. To do this, they must find the right spot and add the feature, without also adding bugs.
* The user wants to fix a bug. They’ll need to find the source of the bug and edit the code so it stops happening, without introducing different bugs.
* The user wants to verify an edge case acts a certain way. They’ll want to find the right code, then trace through the logic to simulate what would happen.

All the above tasks become much more easier if we have readable code, it becomes much more easy to discover the code, it becomes much more easy to understand the code, understandable code leads to lesser bugs.

Now that all this has been said and we do know readable code matters, let's dig into what actually makes code clean/ readable.

### Variable Names
Names are everywhere in software. We name our variables, our functions, our arguments, classes, and packages. We name our source files and the directories that contain them. We name our jar files and war files and ear files. We name and name and name. Because we do so much of it, we'd better do it well.

#### Use intention revealing names
      const d // time elapsed since creation

        **vs**

      const elapsedTimeInDays
      const daysSinceCreation
      const daysSinceInception

#### Don't go vocab while naming    
If names are too clever, they will be memorable only to people who share the author’s sense of humor, and only as long as these people remember the joke.

    whack() vs kill()
    elegantlyConvertToArray() vs toArray()
    deductionMonthSameAsCurrentMonth vs isSameAsCurrentMonth
    getDeductionMonthMoment() vs getTaxPaymentMonth() or getMonthForTaxPayment()

#### Pick One word per concept
Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it. For instance, it’s confusing to have fetch, retrieve, and get as equivalent methods being used in different places for same functionality. 

For example:

    fetchTaxPayment(), getPayouts(), retrievePayoutLinks()

                  vs

    getTaxPayments(), getPayouts(), getPayoutLinks()

#### Add some meaningful context
Suppose there are a few variable names, firstName, lastName, state, city, pincode. It is pretty clear when used together they form address object. Now when you see a state variable being used alone we won't be able to understand the context of the variable whereas when used as `address.state` or `addrState`, the user will be able to understand that it addresses state.

#### Use Domain Specific variable names
Whenever you are confused about a variable name, it is always good to look at what it is called in the business domain or ask your product manager what it is called by business, what is the official term for it.

#### Make meaningful distinctions
A lof of times when we are writing loop in form of map, reduce and filter. We use poor names for the singular element in an array, it can lead to poor readability of code if we are reading values from that singular element. For example
      
### Functions
The first rule of functions is that they should be small and the second rule about functions is that they should be smaller than that. I have written functions of all different sizes. I’ve written several nasty 3,000-line abominations. I’ve written scads of functions in the 100 to 300 line range. And I’ve written functions that were 20 to 30 lines long. What this experience has taught me, through long trial and error, is that functions should be very small.

Now the common question is how short should a function be, Right ? In the old ages people used to say function size should not be greater than the size of the screen, considering the screen size in those days it could be max 24 lines and 80 columns but now with bigger and better screens, font size can be reduced and the function size can be 100 lines easily and 150 characters. So this defintion does not works. 

Story - Robert C. Martin once was looking a visual effects library with Kent Beck, there were a number of visual effects possible with this library for example sparkle etc. Robert C. Martin was mind blown by how small the functions were. Each function was 2 or 3 lines long. Each was transparently obvious. Each told a story and led to the next in a compelling order. That's how short your functions should be!. 

#### Do One Thing
* Functions should do only one thing. They should do it well , They should do it only.

* One level of Abstraction per function - In order to make sure our functions are doing “one thing,” we need to make sure that the statements within our function are all at the same level of abstraction.

* Reading Code from Top to Bottom - We want the code to read like a top-down narrative. We want every function to be followed by those at the next level of abstraction so that we can read the program, descending one level of abstraction at a time as we read down the list of functions.

#### Function Arguments
The ideal number of arguments for a function is zero (niladic). Next comes one (monadic), followed closely by two (dyadic). Three arguments (triadic) should be avoided where possible. More than three (polyadic) requires very special justification—and then shouldn’t be used anyway.

Arguments are also hard from a testing point of view. Imagine the difficulty of writing all the test cases to ensure that all the various combinations of arguments work properly.

#### Have no side effects
Side effects are lies. Your function promises to do one thing, but it also does other hidden things. Sometimes it will make unexpected changes to the variables of its own class. Sometimes it will make them to the parameters passed into the function or to system globals.

#### Do not Repeat Yourself
Duplication may be the root of all evil in software. Many principles and practices have been created for the purpose of controlling or eliminating it. That said premature abstraction is also a problem. If you have all the use cases in your hand go ahead and create an abstraction, otherwise duplication at two places should be fine.

Using all these principle we will refactor a snippet of code

      export const getTaxPaymentDetails = taxPayments => {
        let totalAmount = 0;
        let ids = [];
        let greatestAmount = getIn(taxPayments, [0, 'total_amount']);
        let taxPaymentDetails;
        taxPayments.forEach(taxPayment => {
          totalAmount = totalAmount + taxPayment.total_amount;
          ids.push(taxPayment.id);
          if (taxPayment.total_amount > greatestAmount) {
            greatestAmount = taxPayment.total_amount;
          }
        });
        taxPaymentDetails = {
          paymentMode: greatestAmount > IMPS_THRESHOLD * 100 ? 'RTGS' : 'IMPS',
          ids,
          totalAmount,
        };
        if (taxPayments.length === 1) {
          const tds = getIn(taxPayments, [0, 'tax_payment', 'tds']);
          const tdsCode = getIn(tds, ['tds_category']);
          const createdAt = getIn(tds, ['created_at']);
          taxPaymentDetails.defaultNarration = `TDS ${getIn(tdsCode, [
            'code',
          ])} ${moment.unix(createdAt).format('MMMM YYYY')}`.substr(0, 30);
        }
        return taxPaymentDetails;
      };

This code snipped is not at all readable, it seems to combined of multiple stories or in different words it was doing more than one thing. Variable names were not correct such as `tdsCategory being converted to tdsCode` etc. Functional programming was not fully leveraged. It contains multiple small functions, which in ideal case should be independently unit tested. 


      const getMaximumTax = (taxPayments) =>
            taxPayments
                  .map((taxtPayment) => taxPayment.total_amount)
                  .sort((totalAmountA, totalAmountB) => totalAmountB - totalAmountA)[0];

      const getPaymentMode = (tax) => 
            tax > IMPS_THRESHOLD * 100 ? 'RTGS' : 'IMPS';

      const getDefaultNarration = taxPayment => {
            const tds = getIn(taxPayment, ['tax_payment', 'tds']);
            const tdsCode = getIn(tds, ['tds_category', 'code']);
            const createdAt = getIn(tds, ['created_at']);
            taxPaymentDetails.defaultNarration = `TDS ${tdsCode} ${moment
                  .unix(createdAt)
                  .format('MMMM YYYY')}`.substr(0, 30);
      };

       export const getTaxPaymentDetails = taxPayments => {
            const maximumTaxPayable = getMaximumTax(taxPayments);
            const paymentMode = getPaymenMode(maximumTaxPayable);
            const defaultNarration = getDefaultNarration(taxPayments);
            const taxDetails = taxPayments.reduce((acc, taxPayment) => ({
                ids: [...acc.ids, taxPayment.id],
                totalAmount: acc.totalAmount + taxPayment.total_amount,
                paymentMode,
              }), {});
            return {
                  ...taxDetails,
                  ...(taxPayments.length === 1 ? { defaultNarration} : {})
            }
      }
